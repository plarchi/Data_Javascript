## Data visualisation by Javascript

### Assignment of Data Visulisation (UoL Intro of Programming)

This is a Data Visualization assignment developed by Javascript P5 (Bracket), the Data Set is downloaded from the UK Government. It aimed to develop a web dashboard by Javascript with an existing temple, the bottom four selection is created by myself.

#### Drink Consume Data in CSV Format

The DataSet contained different kind of drink consumption from 2001 to 2019, I tried to represent it in two different format - Scatter and Line Graph.

#### Drink Scatter Visulaization

1. Look up the original code in [drink-scatter.js](https://github.com/plarchi/Data_Javascript/blob/main/drink-scatter.js).

2. The visual representation is under `this.draw` function. With background colour and fixed ellipse size in different colour, the graph shows the different kind of product consume from 2001 to 2019 with ML units.

#### Drink Consume

By using the same dataset from the Drink Consume, another Line Graph Format is created. The original code in [drink-consume.js](https://github.com/plarchi/Data_Javascript/blob/main/drink-consume.js)
The `this.draw` function draw the Line Graph below:

#### Energy Use Summary 2001 to 2021

Different Energy source has be recorded in the dataset in CSV format, I use Bar Char Graph and Bubble Graph to illustrate the total use of energy source from 2001 to 2021

#### UK Energy Use Summary in Bar Chart
The code of the Bar Chart [energy-use-all.js](https://github.com/plarchi/Data_Javascript/blob/main/enery-use-all.js)

#### UK Energy Use Summary in Bubble Graph
The code of the Bubble Chart [energy-use-summary.js](https://github.com/plarchi/Data_Javascript/blob/main/enery-use-all.js)

You can view and change the color of the ellipse by clicking the ellipse on the graph:
